# Tank Battle
>This is a two-person leisure game called tank battle, which allows people to play games and relax in their spare time. The rules of the game are very simple. Two players operate freely in the map I designed and use various methods to destroy each other's tanks.

## Technologies Used
Scratch 3.0
## Features
- The bullets fired by the tank will bounce if they hit the wall, which improves the playability.
- Every time a tank is destroyed, the map will automatically switch, and multiple game scenes will add interest.
- After the tank is destroyed, it will come back to life immediately, and players can quickly fight again.
## Usage
Click the link https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/751790973 to enter the game or search for "Scratch Project (5) (1) (1)" on Scratch.
## Project Status
The project has been completed, and the program basically runs stably, but for some reason, the tank representing Player 1 sometimes fails to fire bullets.
## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Solve the problem that the bullets of tank 2 can't be fired sometimes.

To do:
- Set some props in the game, and if players encounter these props in the game, they can upgrade their tanks.
- Add more map scenes to the game.
## Acknowledgements
- The inspiration of this project comes from a game called "Tank Shooting" that I loved to play when I was a child. Although "tank battle" and "Tank Shooting" are both tank-themed games, I still made many changes, such as the bullet of the tank does not rebound in "Tank Shooting" and so on.
